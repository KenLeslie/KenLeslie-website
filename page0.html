        <h3>My perception in life</h3>
        <p>Since I was a child I always thought that life is better when you grow up, life would be more adventurous and easy as I thought. But when I grow older everyday, I fanally understand what really is the phase of being an adult. I never thought that it would be much difficult to live when you have a lot of problems, and a very crucial struggle you must encounter everyday, living in a real world. I have a lot of realization since I reach the stage of adulthood where I fanally Understand why some people have a suicidal thought, giving up in life, and some have nowhwere to go. Now that I reached the stage of adulthood, I am always reminiscing the days where I am still a child, where I can be happy all the time playing with my play mates and nothing to worry about. But I understand that life must go on and we have to accept that this bis the reality of life.</p>

        <h4>The lesson I've learned from life</i><br></h3>
        <p>The lesson that really stock in my mind and help me keep going is "Never Give Up. Just pray to God every time and think I am special, appreciated and, unique in my own special way" </p>
